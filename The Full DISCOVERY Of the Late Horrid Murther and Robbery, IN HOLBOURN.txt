The Apprehension and Confession OF Iohn Randal that Commited the Late Horrid Murther & Robbery In HOULBOURN.
WE gave you already as full an account as we could of that horrid Murther committed at the house of Esquire Bluck, and though we were then in the Dark altogether, who it might be that should be guilty of that bloody fact, yet since the justice of Heaven, that rarely permits blood to go unrevenged even in this world, hath been pleas'd to make a full Discovery thereof, which we think fit to publish begins as follows.

One John Randal that was formerly Butler to Esquire Bluck, and consequently was well acquainted with all the rooms and places in the house, and kuevv that when the Family used to go out of Town, they left only this poor honest woman the widdow Burton, the party murthered to look to the house, is found to be the bloody actor of this lamentable Tragedy; he is a person of about thirty Years of Age, and was turned avvay from the Esquires service, about half a Year since, which time he vvas married, and since that (as he pretends) has been in Holland, or some part of the lovv Countries, but he had not been near his Masters house from the time of his going avvay, till the Day before the Squire vvent forth of Tovvn.

So that 'tis probably thought, knovving vvhat time he used to go forth vvith his Family, he had before resolved on the vvicked design, and then came vvhen he might have an opportunity, for on Muuday the third instant he came to a Neighbours house, and pointing to Esquire Blucks house, asked vvho Lived at that House, to which the Shop-keeher knovving of him, and vvondring he should ask, told him his Master, to vvhich he replyed, he thought he had been gone, but hovvever he then vvent to the House, and drank vvith this good old vvoman, vvhom he since murthered, vvho made him stay Dinner, and 'tis likely told him her Master vvas to go out of Tovvn, the next Day he came again and Drank vvith her, and on Wednesday brought 3 Razors to be set at the Razorshop next Door, vvhich he left, and vvas seen to go into this House, vvhere (as since appears he did this horrid murther, and so went away


with a considerable quantity of Plate undiscovered, nor was there any likelihood of finding him out: but behold on Friday the seventh instant about eight or Nine a Clock in the Evening, he came to this shop for his Razars, when a Gentlewoman that has part of the Shop having some mistrust of him, because he was the last she saw go into the House before the Murther done, no sooner saw him again but she vvas violently persvvaded he vvas the murtherer, and therefore running vvhilst he stood in the shop to Squire Black, vvho vvas then at home, they got a Constable, and apprehended him, and carried him before a Justice, vvhere he first stoutly denyed the fact, but being asked vvhere his lodging vvas, and ansuering such a place in White-Cross-street, the same vvas order'd to be searcht vvhilst he vvas kept before the Justice, vvhere in his Trunk they found plate of the Squires to the value of forty pounds, vvhich vvas brought and shevved him, and then he confest the fact, declaring that he sat vvith the poor Woman talking till night, and that then she telling him it vvas late, and time for him to be gone, he struck her vvith his Fist and Killed her, but denyed that he had any more Plate, or any money save four four-pence-half-pennies, and one Nine-pence, vvhereupon he vvas committed to Newgate.

The aforesaid fifth of August, the Squire being out of Town with all his Servants at his Countrey-house, at Hunsden in Hertford-shire, about twenty miles from London, having given charge and trust of his house to this antient retainer to his Family of known Fedility, whose care and diligence was manifested

to the last, she having expressed both by the posture she was found in; the Evening before this Horrid murther, she charg'd the Milk-Woman that serv'd the House, that she should call the next Morning, because she should have occasion for some Milk, which accordingly she did; when coming to the Door she found it open, not as it used to be, at which being amazed, she first knocked at the Door for a considerable time, but neither seeing any person, nor hearing any voice she went in, where to her greater astonishment she found the body of the aforesaid Widdow Brown lying in the Parlor with her feet over the threshold, with a Coverlid thrown over her, which made the first discovery of this Horrid Murther and Robbery, upon which coming forth strangely affrighted with this sad spectacle, the Neighbours questioning the reason of her affrightment, she relating the cause, immediately a Constable was sent for, who came as speedily. At which time one of the Esquires Servants from the Country, accidentally comming to fetch some necessaries he was sent for, who meeting the Constable, and seeing such a Tumult at the Door was much astonisht, but hearing what was done, he with the Constable was a spectator, not onely of that sad spectacle of the Murther of the House-keeper, but also went with the Constable to observe what mischief was further acted, and upon search found all the Doors and Locks broke open, as aforesaid: the loss is no way to be computed without the

estemate of the Esquire, who onely knows that great loss he hath sustained; The jealousies concerning the actors as yet undiscovered. 'Ttis hop't, time will produce, and Justice will reward these two great and crying sins rarely remaining without discovery, and vengance following at the heels.

'Tis strangely remarkable that this poor Creature should thus horribly lye strangled black in the face, and cold when she was first found, with her thread about her neck, wherewith she had been working: the bloody Actor not content with binding or gaging, which might have been security sufficient for his intended design of Robbery: but 'tis feared the apprehension of his after discovery, prompted on that lamentable Butchery; the expedition of which Acts gives a further suspition, it being so sudden, even the very Day after the Esq; went out of Tovvn, othervvise 'tis supposed his cruelty had not extended so far.

'Tis further observable, that she never used to let in any into the house, but such, whose voice she well knew; and the street-door, nor the look were not broke although after he had broke the other locks, both of room, truncks, &c. were all broke, and all the said place miserably ransakt, the richest moveables no doubt taken away, all except one plate-dressing-box, which was left on a Cupboards head standing openly.

The Corronar and Jury found it murther.

Remember whatsoever hath been done in the most secret Cell, shall at last be discovered and proclaimed upon the house-top.

Oh that all these late sad examples, which several have so lately suffered the hand of Divine and Humane Justice for, might take that good and everlasting Rule, given to Israel upon this account, might take effect, which was that Israel of old, was therefore spectators of the hand of Justice, that so they might see Justice executed, and hear Sentence past, that they might hear and fear, and do no more any such thing, vvhich is the great design of the publication of these Relations.

And considering all the cruel Circumstances of this most bloody Fact, and the clear Evidence against this person both by the Plate taken in his Custody, and his own Confession, there is small grounds or reason left to hope that he can escape in this world, without satisfying for her Death with his own; though it is to be vvished that by sincere Repentance he may vvash his soul from the stains of blood, and so escape the second Death and punishment everlasting.
