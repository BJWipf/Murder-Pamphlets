Committed on the Body of Walter Osily, by his own Wife on the 31 of this Instant July. Who first strangled him with a Bow-string, and afterwards cut him with a Hatched on the bare Head, and sliting his Nose, giving him a Mortal Wound under the right Ear, with several other Barbarous Inhumanityes, and how after∣wards she discoverd it to a neighbour, as of her being Apprehended, and con∣fession before the Iustice of Peace, as likewise her Commitment to the Marshelseas Prison, where she remains: with several particulars relating to her Life and Conversation. August :2: 1680
WOnderful are the prevailing Insinuations of Hell to delude poor mortals here below as may be well observed in this most barba∣rous and inhumane murther committed by Margaret Osilly up∣on her Husband Walter Osilly, The Relation of which in all its horrid circumstances being as followeth, her Husband having been abroad on Fryday at the Beargarden, to try a Dog that he had lately purchased, came home about nine of the Clock in the Evening somewhat disordered in drink, yet not∣withstanding went out with her to a neighbours house, where they drank toge¦ther, after that they went home seemingly well, but it proved not so, for the being no sooner entered the house but a quarrel arising between them, her hus∣band gave her some blows, the which she to outward appearance seemed not to regard, but converting her resentments to private Revenge, the which she in time found opportunity to effect.

Her Husband being over powered with drink, falling fast asleep she went to a Lodgers Chamber of hers, telling him that her Husband was dead drunk, and that he lay like a Swine upon the Flore, and that he had grievously abused her, whereupon he perswaded her to let him alone till he came to himself and then to get him up to bed; this Discourse being no sooner ended but she returned, and locking the Dores close after her, having a∣waked him, got him (as she since confest) to Bed; where he no sooner fell asleep but the Devil prevailing with her prompted her for to commit a Murder that has since amazed mankind, for in her search for a mischievous weapon to work her revengful Rage she chanced to light upon a Hatchet, the which she poising in her barbarous hand for some small time, at last concluded on the Tragecal Exploit, and with a down-right blow struck her sleeping Husband, who dreamed of no such force, just on the Forehead, making there a wound three inches in length and an inch in depth; but not content with that, being desperately bent on his Destruction, she repeated it with a second just under his right Ear, the which was about an Inch and a half deep which no doubt was mortal an sufficient to translate him to immortal∣lity and after that another that slit his Nose, and a fourth on his hand between his Fingers, the which he was supposed to receive in making resistance; after which, as it is verily conjectured, he lying weltring in his Blood and not presently expiring, she with a Bow-string to make all secure strangled him, and so put him out of the pain; she being resolved to perfect the Cruel Deed, and make end in Death. This Bloody exploit being acted un∣der the Covert of darkness as near as can be conjectured about two of the Clock in the morning, she continuing with the Life∣less Corps till the Light appeared, and without doubt oft view∣ed the dreadful Deed her Cruel hands had done, but with what horror I leave the reader to conjecture by the Guilt. About 8 of the Clock she leaving her Husband in the bloody Bed, went to one Mr. Fowlers in the Maze Yard, where no sooner entering the House, but she desired to speak with him in private, which be∣ing granted, she declared to him the horrid Murther, and how she had acted it in every circumstance desiring him to conceal it or some Report to let her bury him privately in his Ninepin Place; and after having drank there, returned home, but he being a man that detested inch horrid Impieties, went instantly and acqainted

one Mr. Daniel a Hatband maker, with what she related to him, who delayed not to search into the Truth of this strange report so that coming to her House he Knocked at the Dore the which she unwillingly opened, being then smoaking a Pipe of Tobacco in her Chair, but at his importunity she arose and let him in, who no sooner entered, but ask'd for her Husband, to which she repli∣ed he was gon out, but he did not believe it, for was informed that she had murthered him and that he was resoved to search, deman∣ding the Key of the Chamber, the which after some denials she delivered to him and thereupon retird into the next Room lo•k∣ing her self in, upon which going into the Chamber foun the mur∣thered Corps lie welterred in Blood all mangled on Flore, where upon he puting his Head out of the Window, called several neighbours, giving them to understand, that there was Murther done in the House, at which several came in and found the dis∣mal spectacle, at which they started back with horror, some of them immediately running for a Constable to seise the Murthe∣rer, whilst others watched to hinder her from making an escape, but in fine she being apprehended was carried before Justice Free∣man where Mr. Fowler appeared to give Evidence against her who related what she had declared unto him, with many other circum∣stances, whereupon he was bound over to prosecute; It was likewise told her that for that horrid Fact she had committed she would be burnt, to which she replied, she burn'd already and that would prepare her for the Flames to come; or words to that effect: after a full Examination she was committed to the Marshalsea Prison, there to remain till she shall be delivered by due course of Law the Coroner and his Jury sitting upon the Corps retur∣ned it upon their Inquest wilful Murder, &c. This Walter Ossily was formerly her Apprentice, when upon the Death of her for∣mer Husband, she married, his time not being out when he was murthered, it was reported that he was very Familiar with her du∣ring the Life of her former Husband, and that he lay with her the night after he was Buried:

He having been married to her about a twelvemonth, in that time as 'tis said, he had spent and made away of hers about tw• hundred pounds, which extravigance of his and the abusing her a• it is conjectured were the causes for which she murthered him for which no doubt she gave him cause, being a Woman of a Turbulent Spirit, and living much at Varience with her former Husband who was a Castermaker by Trade, of which employ was also the person now murthered. May this sad Crime and cruel murther be a warning to all Christians to deter them from the like Barbarity,
    FINIS.
