AN ACCOUNT Of a Horrid and Barbarous Murder, COMMITTED On the Body of a Young Person supposed to be of a good Quali­ty in the Fields beyond Whitechappel-Church, in the Parish of Stepny commonly known by the Name of Tom-turds Field where she was found, on Munday the 16th. of March, her Throat Cut, and several wounds upon her Body, which was there left stark Naked in one of the Pits belonging to the Field.
DId we not by the too often repeated Instances of this kind behold the Barbarity of Man's Temper, when left of God Almighty, we should be more Astonish'd at the Bloudy and Savage Cruelty in the following Relation, which is enough to draw Tears from the Eyes of the most Unconcer­ned, and raise Pity in the Breast of the worst of Men: But not to detain the Reader with too long Exordi­ums, I shall proceed to the Story it self:

In the Fields beyond White-Chappel Church, com­monly called Tom-turds Fields, some Children were on Munday the 16th of this Instant playing near the Pits, and one of them casually striking his Ball there­into, the Lad endeavouring to reach the same with a Stick lit upon a Foot as he concieved it, and so it pro­ved true, of a Person that had been there Murdered; whereat calling his Companions they came about it, and the Croud increasing, they quickly pull'd the Carkass to the side of the Pit, and by that means per­ceived it was the Body of a Young Woman strip'd stark Naked, except the Lyning of an old-Gown to [Page]Cover her, and on her Right Leg a Mans Stocking and Shoe; she was Bruised all over her Body, and had several Wounds which were seen thereupon; to wit, one in her Right Breast, another upon the side or her Right Eye, and another in her Throat, which was cut half through, with several other Barbarous Gashes in several parts of the Body, The Person is as yet unknown, but by the Conjectures of most Per­sons that have viewed her, she is supposed to be of some Quality, and the rather for that she hath a very Clear Skin and soft Hand; she seems to have several good Features, and is as supposed not above the Age of 16 or 17 at most: on her little Finger of the Right Hand she had a Cornelion Ring, but how long she hath lain in that Place is not yet known, tho it cannot be very long, for that her Wounds are fresh.

And upon the removing her from the Pit where she was first found, to Mile-end-Green at the sign of the George, where her Body now lies, she Bled a fresh: The Field where she was, hath been always looked upon as very Dangerous for Passingers, after Night is shut in, and several Persons have been there Robb'd, but the Barbarity of this is hardly to be Parralleled, not only in Re­lation to her Sex, but also her Youth; And how Malice: it self should be so Trancendently wicked in the perpetration of so Hor­rid and Abominable a Murder, it can scarce enter into the Breast of Humanity to Imagine: Murder in any degree hath been always lookt upon as the most Crying of all Sins, and seldome is it that the same scapes Unpunnished, the Vengeance of the Almighty pursuing the Criminal generally to hss Punnishment even in this World, much more may we hope that in so Horrid an Instance as this is, where neither Beauty nor Youth could work Compassion on the obdurate and Cruel Hearts of Accursed Perpetrators thereof, that in God's good time the same will come to a Discovery, and the Criminals to their deserved End: Which that the same may come to pass, is the Prayers of all good People, who cannot but upon sight thereof compassionate the poor Innocent, and look upon the Au­thors of this Tragedy with more than common Detestation.
