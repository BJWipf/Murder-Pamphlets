A warning for all desperate VVomen.

By the example of Alice Dauis who for killing of her husband was burned in Smithfield the 12 of Iuly 1628. to the terror of all the beholders. To the tune of the Ladies fall.

VNto the world to make my moane,
I know it is a folly,
Because that I haue spent my time,
which haue béene free and iolly,
But to the Lord which rules aboue,
I doe for mercy crie,
To grant me pardon for the crime,
for which on earth I dye.
Hells fiery flames prepared are,
for these that liue in sinne,
And now on earth I tast of some,
but as a pricke or pin,
To those which shall hereafter be,
without Gods mercy great,
Who once more calls vs to account,
on his Tribunall Seate.
Then hasty hairebraind wines take héed,
of me a warning take,
Least like to me in coole of blood,
you burn't be at a stake;
The woman which héere last did dye,
and was consum'd with fire,
Puts me in minde, but all to late,
for death I doe require.
But to the story now I come,
which to you Ile relate,
Because that I haue liued like some,
in good repute and state,
In Westminster we liued there,
well knowne by many friends,
Which little thought that each of vs,
should haue come to such ends.
A Smith my husband was by trade,
as many well doe know,
And diuers merry dayes we had,
not féeling cause of woe,
Abroad together we had bin,
and home at length we came,
But then I did that fatall déede,
which brings me to this shame.
He askt what monies I had left,
and some he néedes would haue,
But I a penny would not giue,
though he did séeme to craue,
But words betwixt vs then did passe,
as words to harsh I gaue,
And as the Diuell would as then,
I did both sweare and raue,


The second Part, To the same tune.
ANd then I tooke a little knife,
and stab'd him in the heart.
Whose Soule from Body instantly,
my bloody hand did part,
But cursed hand, and fatall knife
and wicked was that houre,
When as my God did giue me ore
vnto his hellish power.
The déede no sooner I had don,
But out of doores I ran,
And to the neighbours I did cry,
I kil'd had my goodman,
Who straight-way flockt vnto my house,
to sée that bloody sight,
Which when they did behold with griefe,
it did them much affright.
Then hands vpon me there was lay'd,
And I to Prison sent,
Where as I lay perplext in woe,
and did that déede repent,
When Sizes came I was arraign'd,
by Iury iust and true,
I was found guilty of the fact,
for which I haue my due.
The Iury hauing cast me then,
to iudgment then I came,
Which was a terrour to my heart,
and to my friends a shame,
To thinke vpon my husbands death,
and of my wretched life,
Betwixt my Spirit and my flesh,
did cause a cruell strife.
But then the Iudge me sentence gaue
to goe from whence I came
From thence vnto a stake be bound
to burne in fiers flame,
Vntill my flesh and bones consum'd,
to ashes in that place,
Which was a heauie sentence then,
to on so uoyd of grace.
And on the twelfth of Iuly now,
I on a sledge was laid,
To Smithfield with a guard of men
I streight way was conueyd,
Where I was tyed to a stake,
with Reedes was round beset,
And Fagtos, Pitch, and other things
which they for me did get.
Now great Iehouah I thee pray,
my bloudy sinnes forgiue,
For on this earth most wretched I
vnworthy am to liue.
Christ Iesus vnto thee I pray,
and vnto thee I cry,
Thou with thy blood wilt wash my sinnes
away, which heere must dye.
Good wiues and bad, example take,
at this my cursed fall,
And Maidens that shall husbands haue,
I warning am to all:
Your Husbands are your Lords & heads,
you ought them to obey,
Grant loue betwixt each man and wife,
vnto the Lord I pray.
God and the world forgiue my sinnes,
which are so 〈◊〉 and foule,
Sweete Iesus now I come to thée,
O Lord receiue my Soule.
Then to the Réedes they fire did put,
which flamd vp to the skye,
And then she shriek'd most pittifully,
before that she did dye.
The Lord preserue our King & Queene,
and all good Subiects blesse,
And Grant the Gospell true and free,
amongst vs may encrease.
Betwixt each husband and each wife,
send loue and amitie,
And grant that I may be the last.
that such a death did dye.
    FINIS.
