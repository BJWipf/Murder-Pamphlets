The unnatural Mother: being a full and true account of one Elizabeth Kennet, a marry'd woman, living in Robin Hood's Court in Shoe-lane, who, on Tuesday the 6th of April 1697, privately deliver'd herself, and aferwards flung her infant in the fire, and burnt it all to ashes, but a few of the bones. 
Likewise of her being had before a justice, and her confession there.

Daily instances of barbarities, one would think, should be enough to terrifie a Christian people from the like, but the Devil is so busie, that scarce a day passes, but some inhumane murder is committed; and this which I am going to give you a relation of, I think is one of the cruellest and most unnaturalest of the age; it being committed by a mother, and a married woman, n her own instant; which you may take as follows.

This cruel mother before mentioned, is one Elizabeth Kennet, her husband being a Pavier, and a house-keeper, and one that is well to pass, and is likewise the repute of a very honest man, and always very kind until Elizabeth Kennet his wife; she being very big, her husbandw ould ask her why she did not provide things for the hcild against she was brought to bed? but she still would make him a reply, that he need not trouble himself, for she has provided well enough; and on Tuesday in Easter-week, she was that morning at a neighbours house merry, and eating some gammon of bacon, and her husband the same day happened to take a walk to Hampstead, and returning in the evening found a hubbard about his House, but soon perceiving the occasion, was ready to run distracted; and is now in such  trouble condition, that every body that knew him does heartily pitty him: the occasion of which is by his wife, who in his absence, happened to fall in labour, but called for no woman about her; but after delivering of her self, 'tis thought she warpped the child in a cloth and flung it in the fire, where it was consumed all but a few of the bones; there has been a minister who prayed with her, then taxed her with making away of her infant; she denies her own doing of it, but charges a neighbouring woman that she took it from her and carried it to the Thames and drowned it; the poor woman wrings her hands and tears her hair, and is ready to run distracted, and does protest she was not in the room when she was delivered, nor never saw any child she had; the mother will not confess as yet that she flung her child in the fire, though there is several of the bones found, which she pretends to be the bones of a lamb which she had the day before; and on Wednesday afterward flung her infant in the fire, and burnt it all to ashes, but a few of the bones. Likewise of her being had before a Justice, and her confession there.
