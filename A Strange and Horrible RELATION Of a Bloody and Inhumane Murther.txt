A Strange Relation of a Horrible Murther, Committed on the Body of a Jewish Woman, by the command of her own Father a Jewish Priest.
A Jewish Priests Daughter being with Child by a Gentleman who pretended love to her, but when her Father know it, he kept her in, and never allowed her to see him afterward, but when her full time came that she should be delivered, there was hired a Sedan to fetch a Mid-wife, and they carried her through so many by Alleys and Lanes, and being Night, she knew not which way, nor where she went, but they conveyed her to a house, where in the first Room she came in, thare was a very large Fire, and six Gentlemen all Maskt, the Mid-wife being amaz'd, she asked them if they had any thing for her to do, they replyed they had, whereupon one of them had her up in another Room, where four Gentlemen were in black and Maskt, and a very hansom young Gentlewoman in paine, crying and taking on very much, the Mid-wife desiring her to be patient, there was no fear of her safe delivery, but she said it was not that troubled her, but she said that when she was delivered, she must be Burned in that fire that was below, within an hour after she was delivered: After she had Delivered the Woman, one of the Gentlemen gave her Thirty Guines in her hand, and sent her away in the Sedan, she was hardly got down stayers, but she heard her screech and cry. This action was performed so secreetly, that the Midwife cannot tell in what part of the City it was acted, wishing she could make a further discovery of those unnatural and Bloody Murtherers.


THE BLOODY SERVANT, OR, The Horrid Murther in Shrop-shire, &c.
JOhn Adams, the Committer of this Barbarous Murther, which we are goeing to relate, lived at a place called Streton in the County of Sallop, as an hired (though not menial) Servant to John Harris a Sawyer in that Town, and had workt with him Several yeares, and during all that time, carryed himself very civilly and honestly; but see! what a mighty Temptation is money, and how dangerous a thing it is to set our Hearts upon Covetousnesse, and getting Riches by unlawful means; this story is hereof a most pregnant Instance; For though this poor man had hitherto led an unblamable life, yet not being solidly grounded in virtuous principles, or to speak more properly, wanting the grace of God, without

which all our Inclinations are evil, altogether evil, and that Continually; he was no sooner Baited by the Devil with an opportunity, but he Committed one of the most Barbarous Crimes that has been heard of in our Age, though to fruitful, and every day teeming with fresh and unheard of Assassinations, and bloody Cruelties; For about the moneth of July last, his Dame (who managed the business of a Dary distinctly by her self, as her husband did his own trade) haveing sold two Cows, and received the Summ of Ten Pounds for them, which this John their man very well knowing, presently began to harbour the accursed thoughts of Robbing her of this money, and proposed several stratagems in his wicked Brain for the accomplishment of this design; At last the Devil and he concludeb their Consultation in a Resolution which he forthwith Resolves to put in Execution, And accordingly on the 13. day of January instant, his Master haveing taken some worke at a place called Cardington, about Eight Miles from Streton, went out somewhat early in the morning with this fellow, intending to go thither to his businesse, But John heareing as we said before, concluded on his black Project, in order thhreunto, purposely leaves some of his Tools behind at home, and when they had wlakt about a mile, All of a sudden, Cries out to his Master, that he had forgot them, who presently bid him run back for them, and said that he would walk on before, which was what his man desired; Accordingly the fellow came back towards the house, approching within sight of it, and revolving in his mind what he was going about, his

Conscience as yet not wholly seared, began to fly in his face, and check him from so base an Action, though at that time (as he has since affirmed) he meant his Dame no hurt, but only to have bound her or the like, and taken her mony, and so have run clear out of the Country, but then he began to fear, she knowing him so well, Hue and Cry would be sent out after him, and that he should not cleverly escape, whereupon he began to think of waveing the designe wholly, and doubtlesse had so done, If the Devil (who always attends persons that go on such disperate attempts, still pricking them forwards to their finial distruction) had not stept in Just in the nick to confirm him in the aforesaid Hellish Resolution, and render it more hainous, by adding the Guilt of Murther to the Crime of Theft; For as he was walking near the house in the feilds thus melancholly, and troubled in his thoughts, not knowing what to do, Behold to his apprehension, two men in black (undoubtedly two Feinds in Masquerade) appeared to him, and demanded the cause why he was so Melancholly, and assured him it lay in their power to help him, whatsoever the matter might be, He thereupon reveals his mind to them, and said his Dame had received Ten pounds which was now in the house, and that he had a mind to it, but did not know how to get it securely, whereupon one of the seeming men pulled out a long knife with a black haft, and turning crooked, almost like a little Scymetar from under his Coat, and said (as he since attested at his death) go and Cut thy Dames Throat whith this, and thou shalt never be discovered,

nor so much as mistrusted to be concerned in it, and besides, shalt never want as long as thou livest, upon which perswasions, He takes new Courage to perpetrate the villany, and receiving the fatall Knife from them, goes boldly with it to the house, where he found his Dame Innocently, all alone, at her Wheel a Spinning, but little Dreaming that the tread of her life was so soon to be Cut off; she no sooner saw him, but very kindly she demanded the reason of his so sudden unexpected return, but his heart was too much set upon wicked deeds to answer her with words, and therefore instead of a reply, he run up furiously unto her, and draging her by the hair to the ground, with the aforesaid Knife barbarously Cut her Throat, makeing an Orifice about Seaven Inches long, and above two deep, so that her Wind-pipe was Cut clear asunder, At which inforced passage her affrighted Soul wasted forth in a Crimson Flood, and left her soon breathlesse Corps weltring in its own blood on the Floor whilst the inhumane Murtherer greedily fell to Search and pillage the house, but looking through the Window saw his Dames Daughter comeing along the next field, having been at Mill at the next Village; He now knew not what to do for he found he should be discovered if he did not dispatch her also, and therefore slipping behind the door, and holding his Knife ready Just as she came in, he Caught her about the Neck, and Cut her Throat in the same manner as he had done her Mothers, and then applyed himself again to Ransack the house, where at last he found the said 10. Pounds in mony, and two Gold


Rings which he put into his Pocket, And to Cover his bloody Fact, Sets the house on fire, Concluding that people would Judge it came by Accident and that the two Women were Casually burned in it, and haveing set the Thatch all on fire he got away undiscovered by any, but it happened that a Butchers boy coming presently by with some Cattel seeing the house on fire gave notice to the neighbours, who came in so Seasonably that in short time they quenched it, and then found the two Bodies, their hinder-parts allmost Burnt to peices, but their Heads and shoulders untoucht, so that their gaping Wounds still with fresh Blood plainly appeared, whence it was evident that they must have been Murther'd, and the House set on fire on purpose, but who should do it, they were Ignorant, till providence discovered it: For the Murtherer, though before he resolved to run quit out of the Country, yet had not now power so to do, nor yet durst he appeare abroad, but lay Lurking in Woods, and out-barns thereabouts, and the next Night Robed another house, but met with very little booty, his absenting himself made his Master and all others Conclude him the person guilty, and at last upon strict search they found him on the top of an Hay-Reeke, and look the money and Rings in his Pocket, Upon his Examination before a Justice, he Confessed the whole matter; and being Committed to Goal, was at the Quarter-sessions of Shrewsbury, Condemned to dye, and be Hanged up in Chains near the place where he did the Fact; Before his Death, he seeemed excâ€¢eding penitent, and desired


very passionately at the place of Execution, that all Servants might take warning by him, not to Entertain the least thought of wronging those they dwell with, but to be Content with their honest wages, and beware of Satans temptations which had brought him to that miserable and untimely End, the Knife was produced in Court at his Tryal, and is now to be seen publiquely in Shrewsbery being of a very unusual shape, and what is very remarkable, some of the blood sticking on it, can by no means be got off, but remains still as fresh as if it had been but just now contracted.
