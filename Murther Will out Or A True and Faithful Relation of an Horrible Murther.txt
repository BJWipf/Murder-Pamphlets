Murther vvil out.
To religious hearts there is nothing so distasteful as Sin, nor any Sin so odious and execrable as Murther: For it being contrary to Nature and Grace; the very thought, much more the act thereof strikes horrour to their Hearts and Consciences; Wherefore if this foul and bloody sin is so displeasing to godly Men, how infinitely more detestable is it then to God himself; who made all Living creatures for to serve Man, and onely created Man and VVoman to serve himself; but as chollars proceeds from the passions of a man or Wom, so doth Murther from the Devil, for else we should not so often and frequently see it perpetrated in most Countries of the World; A mourful but true example I here produce to your serious consideration; in the parish of Stephney, lived a Widdow Woman, whose name i shall forebear to name, upon the account of a Son of hers living in Redriffe Parish: This Widdow being left with one small child, about half a yeare old, seemed to be satisfied at the loss of her husband, and well contented that she had of this seed left her which she hoped would prove a comfort to her after some trouble and cost in bringing him up; which she resolves within her self should not be wanting from her, though she worked her fingers to the bone; and in this mind she continued for some time after the disease of her dear husband; but the child being visited by the hand of Almighty God with a lingering distemper, made it very froward both by night and day, and so continued for a long time pining away, and with its continual crying a nights made its Mothers life very uncomfortable, but this poor Woman bore up under it as well as could be expected for a weak Vessel, but as last having laid out most of what she had upon the Doctors for cordials for her child, she began to murmuer at the hard providence as she thought it, that had brought her into so sad a condition, and this was the way Satan began to work upon this poor Woman, first to think hardly of God who thus afflicted her, telling her that she got by her hearing of these good men as she called them; and so by degrees those subtile temptations of the Devil wrought so much upon the Woman; being oft alone, and being kept awake when that nature should have been a refreshing with sleep, I say upon her pillow, she rumianted upon what Sata nhad suggested to her, and giving way to this grand enemy of her salvation, she soon was made a slave to him; he heaving got such strong hold and good footing never lets her alone but follows her from place to place, in her out-goings he is with her, and is not this sad to be lead by the Devil, to have him for ones Companion, to walk with, to have this fiend so be by us, nay, in us, and a counsellour to us, as this poor miserable soul had, who was so hurried about by him that she could have no rest till she had done what he requited, which he told her would be for her ease and comfort: for for non says he you are unhappy onely in this hcild of yours, which as long as it lives you will never enjoy a good day: and besides it hinders your preferment; you are young and handsome, and might have a husband or two more if this childs head ws but laid, but who do you think will come to wooe you as long as this froward Child is with you: and therefore it is your best way to rid your hands of it: These and the like htoughts the Devil continually filled her heart with: insomuch as she coul dhave no quitness: at last she begins a parley with the Devil: and, Oh said is it when we stand and parley with him in our own strength: If she had gone to Christ when she was tempted: and cryed, O Lord, Satan seeks to make a prety of my Soul, he tempts me to have hard thoughts of thee night and Day, and never gives me rest, but would have me lay violent hands upon the fuirt of my Womb, promising me happiness in so doing, and pronouncing me miserable if I do it not: Now Lord I come to thee for supporting grace, I am a weak creature and not able to resist this adversary of my soul, much less to overcome him, but I come to thee for thou art able to tread Satan under thy foot, do it Lord for thy names Sake; I say, if this poor tempted soul had upon the first temptation of Satan gone to Crhist, and in the like manner laid open her case before him, doubtless she had found him ready to help her and deliver her, but she not doing this will of God be not infinite mericful in the blood of his son will be her undoing. For Satan at last prevaded on her to lay violent hands upon the poor innocent Babe in the manner and form as followeth: She resolves that she will not lead such an uncomfortable life any longer and therefore thinks of many wayes how she may send her hcild out of the World, for as how to be mistrusted that she killed it, whereupon she being to go to the Bake0house, takes her Child and lays it upon the Bed, and lays pillow upon the mouth of it, and non questioning but that would dispatch it before she came again, but returning she found it alive: thinks of another way; for now the Devil who had brought it so far was resolved to help her to finish it, and accordingly another way is thought of: Viz, To put the Child under a Tub, so whelmed down the Tub close to the ground: This stragedem proved effectual, she haveing put it under in an hours tie takes it up to see if the Child was dead, found it to be almost cold: whereupon to blind the Eyes of her Neighbours, she runs out and cryed that her Child was Dead, and that it Dyed while she was gone to the Bake House; the Neighbours all believe that it went away in a Fit: and all appeared to be well, that a Woman soon afterwards Martyred and had a brave Boy, which is now grown to Mans estate, she hath lived above this thirty years with her husband that now is, and nothing known.
But mark how the Wife All-seeing and sin-revenging God brings this bloody crime to light. About a fort-night ago this Woman was visited with a Cold that was a common distemper, and with that a Feaver succeeded that appeared to be mortal, not onely to those that were about her, but her self apprehended the Danger; Upon which she was exceedingly Disquieted at the Remembrance of her formy bloody crime, and could not rest till she had revealed it in manner as before, for which she was though in a very weak condition, carried in a Coach to Prison; she further told that she cannot nor shall not dye till she be hanged.
Finis.
