The unnatural grand mother, or a true relation of a most barbarous murther, committed by Elizabeth Hazard who sold fruit in Cheapside, near Soper lane end, on her Grand childe, of about two years old by drowning it in a tub of water, on Friday the 15 of July 1659. 
Together with, the manner of her apprehending, and examination before my Lord Mayor, likewise the sending her to Newgate where she now remains in a sad condition.

The Unnatural Grand-mother or a most wretched murther committed by Elizabeth Hazard a woman, that sold Ornges and lemmons near Soper Lane end in Cheap-side.
Murder is a crying sin, and of it self, commonly its own discoverer, as will appear in this insuing lamentable discourse.
Of all examples weighing the circumstances of this, none more horrid and cruell, as ever I heard or read of. But I must needs confess that every age that produced examples of most horrid murthers committed, and of the judgment of God that hath so closely pursued them at the heels, that they have tripped them up, and in such a fearfull manner, that their heels have kickt at heaven, while their souls have snuck down into the punishment and center of sin. 
But surely this age hath brought forth more horrid murders then ever was committed since the world began, which would make you belieeve that murder is almost priviledged: and that the sun hath seen and smiled at such murders at which in the modestly of former times he would have started baack, or withdrawn himselfe behind a cloud, rather then to have beheld them, but blood is a crying sin, and cryeth unto God for vengeance, and though a long time it hath concealed, yet it hath alwaies found a rogue at last, and spoke as loud as thunder.
Of which before I do proceed to the main subject of this discourse, I shall give you some instances of murders that have been committed of late, and most remarkable.
The first is not two years since that notorious murther was committed on John Knightan apprentice in Millestreet by his deer friend and associate Nathaniel Butler, the chief occasion of mentioning of this, was because my self and many more were eye witnesses of the disturbing of conscience, this young man had at the remembrance of that bloody and horrid murther, crying out day and night against himself, for the guilt of all his hainous crimes, and that of murdering his friend most especially, and for mercy from the Almight, which I have no doubt but as last he received.
The second is not a year since committed by Mr. George Strange-wayes on the person of his brother-in-law, Mr. John Fussel, who was shot with a brace of bullets in his chamber near Temple-Bar, who for his bloody fact, was, (refusing to answer to his indictment) condemned to be pressed to death, which was accordingly done on the 26 of February 1658. For which there was many weeping eyes, because Mr. Fussell had provoked him some wayes by injuring him in his estate; but God who is just, will have judgment left to himselfe, not suffering any one to be their own revenger; For were it not for the law, the which I think is not more justly administered (as to the matter of murther) in any part of the world then in England, how should we be able to walk the streets, keep company, traffique one with another, nay sleep in our beds, as appeareth by this wretched womans murthering her Grand-child the which is not to be parralleled, I could give you many more examples both ancient, and of our times, but that i am loath to hold you any longer from the thing at hand; Therefore I shall proceed to the story.
The horridness of the crime, which I am going to write, almost fills my eyes with tears, and puts a stop to my pen, when I consider, what the Apostle Saint Paul says, that he is worse than an infidel, that look not after his own family. But oh the greatest of horros; What shall we think of this unnatural Grand-mother? That in stead of nourshing, and cherishing that which came at first from her own loines, she so unwomanlike and unnaturally hath now destroyed.
We will put the case, if any should be so impudently bold to plead for revenge, and so go about to justify murther for some abuses or injuries formerly committed (as may be foolishly pretended) but alas what can be said in such a case as this, wherein there is nobody to plead but an innocent grand-child against an unnaturall grandmother; with thousands of teares and acclamations of an indulgent and carefull Mother, against her mother who first gave her breath, and now hath almost destroyed her, by murthering the child which she had so many heavy pangs and grones for; but oh the cruelty and bloodiness of this age we live in, where some Jesuits, or rather divils, stick not to affirm that killing is no murther; and it is to be feared that too many of these are mixed amongst the people throughout this nation, in all soceities, as appeares in these and such like horrid crimes; and I am afraid amongst them brainsick people the Quakers, who they have led into nothing but madness and folly, as we see daily appear in their running up and down the streets naked, and such other foolish, and sordid actions. 
But to the purpose, the mother of this child, having late laine in of another child, and being a woman that was forced to take paines for her living (in the same calling as her mother followed, which was to sell all manner of fruit in a remarkable place in Cheapside, neer Soper-land end, under the signe of the Golden-key) was constrained to carry her youngest child some miles distance from London to nurse, because she thought she should have it cheaper nurst then at London. In the interim the devil, and her unnaturall mother, taking advantage of her absence, strikes a bargain, that she should fall out with her maid servants, that had so long served her, and commonly used to lie with her, and she should no longer lie with her, which was presently performed, and she sent for the poor innocent child from her nurse which being brought unto her, she for that night smothers her murdering intentions; and sends her maid away, and as it was thought in love, takes the poor innocent babe in her armes, where after many murthering and dissembling kisses they go to bed; but poor innocent creature, thy hours was but short; for the unnatural Grand Mother was no sooner in her Bed, and the poor harmles child asleep by her (which was as innocent as the Grand-mother was unnaturall and cruell) but that she was with the help of the Divil (who is assiting in all such bloody deeds of Darkness) it is contriving which way to destroy this poor babe. First she thinks ot stab it, then to stifle it, then her better angels, layes before her the horridness of the crime, what the sin of murder is, and what the punishment; with these sweet allays she falls asleep (it had been well if it had been for ever) but the Devil that never sleeps, soon awakens her, lays before her the charge her daughter had of children, and a bad husband that would not endeavour to maintain them; and how that she was indebt, and like to run her self more in debt toward the maintaining of them (with many such devilish and deceitfull suggestions which apt to take with any that the Lord hath left, and given over to themselves) following in this dangerous and distressed condition, she no sooner see day break, but she violently slips out of the bed, and more like an infernal Hal, then the mother or grandmother of children, without any fear or remorse of conscience, catches the poor harmless child as it lay in a sweet slumber, up in her wretchless arms, thinking to knock the brains of it out, but spying a great tub of water, she thought that would be the speediest death, whereupon she cacht the poor child by the heels, and thrust the head of it in the tub of water, and so held it under water while she had drowned it.
And having committed this abominable and wicked murder, she put on her best apparel, and took six pound in her pocket, and as it is conjectured thought to make her escape: but God who will not suffer the murderer to go unpunished, made some of the neighbors marvel being working-day at her being so fine, whereupon one or two of them said good morrow Gammer Hazzard, you are very fine this morning, what are you not going to the market today, yes yes, faith she, but calls a made by her name that was there. Mary preethee come in faith she, and see what I have done this morning, and so carries the maid to the tub, which she had drowned the child in, the which the maid seeing, she got to the window and opened it, and cryed murder, murder, whereupon the neighbours came in, and there they found the poore drowned child, to the extream sorrow and grief of all the Spectators, who presently apprehended her, and carried her before Alderman Ireton, now Lord Mayor of London, who after examination (she not denying the fact but either madly or impudently affirming that if it were to do so again she would do it) and many pious instructions for her souls good, committed her to Newgate, where she doth lye till Sessions, to answer for this wicked crime.
And it is reported by severall poeple that for this many years, she hath been tempted to kill the mother of this child before she was married, and had hid knives at severall times to that intent; But God did prevent it.
Finis.
